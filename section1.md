# **Basic Vi Commands and Definitions**

***cd*** = stands for change directory and is used for navigating through our computer folders

If you are in the folder already use "`cd /<name>`

***mkdir*** = stands for Make Directory

It is used to create new directories within existing directories in order to store work for the repository.

Implemented by typing `mkdir` followed immediately by the name of the new directory

***cp*** = stands for copy and is used for copying files or directories

This command reuqires two arguments after the command for it to work correctly

To implement this command type `cp` followed by the two `file names`

***pwd*** = stands for "present working directory" and is used to print the current working directory path being used

To implement this command correctly, simply type `pwd` in command line

***mv*** = stand for move and is used for moving files or directories from one place to another. It can be used for single files, multiple files and directories.

This command requires atleast one source and one destination to be implemented correctly. The destination is where the source or sources will be moved to.

To correctly use this command, simply type `git mv` followed by source and destination

***rm*** = stands for remove and is used for removing files from the Git Repository

To correctly use this command, simply type `git rm` followed by the `name of the file` that you want removed.

***History*** = to find the commit history of a specific repository you must go to the commit section and click on a specific file to see the changes and inputs.

***Home Directory and "~"*** = the Home Directory is where the work is stored for the repository. The tilde symbol is used for referencing parent commits and previous heads within the branch.

***File Paths in linux*** = this is a readable representation of a file or folders location within the computer system. This makes it easier to track a file/folder.

***Using TAB key to complete file paths*** = This method is used in order to make it easier to quickly get to the right file name by beginning to type the name of the file and then hitting the TAB key in order to complete the name without having to type the rest out manually.

This method is useful when you have many files and want to quickly retrieve one file. 

If two or more files have similar names, you must type out enough of the file name so the program will recognize the file you want to retrieve and not get it confused with another file before hitting the TAB key.

***Using Up and Down Arrow for History*** = this action will retrieve previously typed code starting with the most recent code in order to save the user time when typing repetitive code. You can also view previous code with this function without scrolling up through the terminal.
