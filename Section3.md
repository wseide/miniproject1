### To Setup GIT
Get a Github account from [Github](Github.com)
Download and install `git` onto your computer
Set up `git` with your `user name` and `email`

Once `git` is setup you can clone repository onto your local machine.

Then we can setup your own branch using the comamnd line in your Terminal:

`git checkout -b <branch name>`

Then you will be able to work within your branch

### Concept of Branching
We branch in Git and Github to protect our work and to protect work of others. With branching we can work collaboratively on one project and if we are working on the same material we can request a review and the person who review the quality of the code can push the correct code into the master branch. 

### Avoiding the merge conflict
We avoid merge conflicts by having someone review any request to push to the master branch. 



### Forking vs Cloning  
**Forking:** When you fork a repository you are copying the entire repository to your github account.  People use to make invoke a change to their repository or to use is as a starting point for their project.

To fork a repository go to that repository in Github. In the upper right corner click the fork image and you will copy the repository onto your account.

Check your repositories and you should see the forked repository on your Github account.

**Cloning:** When you clone a repository you are copying the repository onto your local machine. 

**To clone a repository from Github:**
1. Click the Clone or download
2. You have a choice to either download the repository to a zip file or you can clone using a password protected SSH Key
3. If you are cloning with SSH, ensure your public key is enabled and loaded.
4. Open your Terminal and change to the directory you want to clone your repository
5. Use command `git clone <name of repository>`
6. The repository and the alloted filed should be on your local machine

### Pull Request
**Pull Request:** We make pull request to make changes and/or collobrate to a repository.

To create a pull a request:

`git request-pull [-p] <start> <url> [<end>]`

-p i
